# Large Scale Machine Learning 2018 Practical Sessions

## Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the first  afternoon of practical sessions of the LSML 2018 course.

To run the notebooks, you need to start Jupyter by typing

  ```jupyter notebook```

in a terminal. This will open a file navigator in your web browser. Navigate to this repository. You can then open any notebook by clicking on it.

If you are already familiar with Python and numerical Python (numpy) as well as matplotlib, you can start with Notebook 3. We recommend, however, doing the small problems in Notebooks 1 and 2 to familiarize yourselves with Jupyter and refresh your knowledge of these tools.

The focus of our first afternoon of practicals is going to be Notebooks 3 and 4, which introduce data manipulation and machine learning with scikit-learn.
